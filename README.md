# Build a Scatter Plot with D3

Scatter plots, sometimes also known as bubble charts, are another common type of visualization. Theyâ€™re extremely versatile thanks to their ability to display multiple dimensions of data simultaneously using x and y position, opacity, color, and even shape. This lesson introduces the SVG `circle` element as part of building a robust scatter plot.
